A collection of my personal projects and Java Capstone assignments from my Java Programming courses at City College of San Francisco. 

1) Bank Account Program

A Java Program which lets the user enter his/her name, Account ID, to get his/her balance statement and to calculate the interest rate.

My second Java Capstone project lets the user draw squares and adding a square on each corner using Recursion. My classmate Tatsuya Hayashi and I worked on this Capstone project together. 

4) Student Class Roster Program: Capstone Teamwork Project 3

My third and final Java Capstone project lets the user enter specific details about the maximum amount of students to sign up for classes, while providing details about the student's name and to check if a class has reached the full roster capacity. My classmate Shaoliang Lin and I worked on this Capstone project together.
